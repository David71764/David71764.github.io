# About Me


I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [Institute of Frontier and Interdesciplinary Science](https://frontier-en.qd.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Shandong University](http://www.en.qd.sdu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes High Energy Physics, Quantum Information and Quantum Computing, and Quantum Machine Learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanlin Liu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuyanlin1/zh_CN/index.htm) of ATLAS Collaboration Group from [Institute of Frontier and Interdesciplinary Science](https://frontier-en.qd.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm), Shandong University.
