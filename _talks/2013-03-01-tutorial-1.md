The 2025 Joint TDLI and INPAC Winter School in Particle Physics is an intensive academic program hosted at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, running from January 20 to January 24, 2025. Organized by the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI) and the Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics, Astronomy and Cosmology (INPAC), this school is designed to provide graduate students and young researchers with a deep and comprehensive understanding of key topics in modern particle physics.

The curriculum features a series of in-depth lectures delivered by leading experts in the field. The core topics covered include:

- Quantum Field Theory

- Dark Matter

- Accelerator Physics

- Collider Physics

- Neutrino Physics

In addition to the lectures, the program includes dedicated sessions for student presentations and discussions, fostering an interactive learning environment. This structure allows participants to not only learn from established scientists but also to present their own work and engage in scientific dialogue with their peers. The winter school serves as a valuable platform for young physicists to broaden their knowledge base and build connections within the international particle physics community.
